#History


A young man is digging a tunnel in a desert. In the search of some ancient relicts. Before he starts his work, a friend tells him to take one of three things with him aside of the Basic shovel that he will have.
He can choose between a lighter, a rope, a bottle of water.
After some digging, he stumbles about a long closed door deep under the sand. He decides to open the door. behind it a huge dungeon was hidden. He carefully starts entering the first room.
If Torch: He takes some of his own cloth and put it on the end of its shovel and light it with the lighter to get a torch. He finds a easy way around the hole in the floor and reach the room with the strange light
If Other tool: It's so dark that he stumbles around a bit to see if he can find some way to reach a other room with more light. There seems to be a light at the other side of the room. He carefully starts going towards it but it is so dakr, that he did not see a hole in the ground and he fell in.
He looks around, it seems as its just some meter high.
If rope: He takes the rope and makes a "Schlaufe" and throw it up, he somehow manage to get it stuck on something and climbs out the hole and finally can reach the next room with the strange light the rope however was damaged by friction and is useless now.
If: Bottle of water: there seems to be no way out here, he tries for days to climb out of the hole. The bottle of water he had is slowly running out of water and finnaly he dies there.
Once he reached the room with the strange light, he sees that the light comes from a huge diamond that is on a pedestal in the middel of the room. In the seeling there is a hole and the sun is shining in, pointing direkctly on the diamond what makes the room shine like there was a disco bole.
He looks around, the room is shaped as a pentagon and there are 4 doors going out. Including the one he just came from.
he goes nearer to the diamond. It does not seem to be fixed in anyway on the pedestal. No mecanism or trap seems visible. So he finally decides to carefully take it down.
But he was wrong. once he completly took of the weight of the pedestal a "click" sounds and a deep rumbling goes throguh the dungeon.
Suddenly the sealing of the room that he just have come from falls down and the way is blocked.
So now he only can choose between 3 doors.
He does not know what is behind each of this doors. There are no marks or hinds what could be behind this doors. So he has to decide for one of them.

1: he opens the door slowly and finds a long dark tunnel. is in front of him. he starts to go along it step by step to not fall into a hole again.
If Water bottle: luckyly he has taken the water bottle with him because the coridor is very long and he had to rest a lot of times without it he would have died. At the end of the corridor he reaches a new room with a staircase going up.
If other tool: he noticed that the corridor is very long but he realizes this so late that at the end there is no way that he can make it back. He finally dies in the tunnel because he has no water....

2: behind door two there there is a big pool and on the other side a room with a staircase going upstairs. He starts to swim over when suddenly a corcodile catchs his left leg throw him under water and easts him.

3: behind door three there is a round arena. The floor is full of different weapons. He chooses one without knowing what is coming for him.
Sword: A tiger apears and atacks him. He fels backwards on the ground but the Tiger jumps streight into the sword. The tiger dies and he is able to cross the arena and go through the door and he reached a room with a Staircase going upstairs.
Crossbow:A tiger apears and atacks him. he tries to aim with the crossbow and shoots, but fails the bolt. The tiger gets to him and rip him apeart.
Shield:A tiger apears and atacks him. He blocks the claw atacks for a while with the shield but finally the tiger learn how to get around the shiled and rip him apart.
Spear:A tiger apears and atacjs him. He  sticks the speark into the floor in the direction the tiger is coming from. The tiger is so hungry and desperate that he does not see it comin and jumps streight into it an die. He can cross tha arena now and reach a room with a Staircaise going upstearis.

He goes the stairsup and at the end of the stairs he reached a small hatched door that leades again back to the superfice and he can escape the dungeon. From there on he lifed happy and rich in a small house that he bought.
